Jan Malburg and Gordon Fraser, *Combining Search-based and Constraint-based Testing*, ASE 2011.

##### ii1: *genetic algorithm*
This paper describes a search technique based on genetic algorithms, a meta-heuristic algorithm that searches by maintaining a set of candidate solutions and generating new ones by combining the current (near-)best solutions.

##### ii2: *constraint solver*
The paper uses constraint solving algorithms in complement with a genetic algorithm. Constraint solvers find a solution satisfying a set of hard constraints, which is used during the mutation step of the genetic algorithm.

##### ii3: *test generation*
The goal of the paper is a reliable method for automatic test case generation, which attempts to automatically generate test cases with sufficient code coverage.

##### ii4: *white-box testing*
White-box testing, which is addressed in the paper, refers to the fact that the source code is available during test case generation.
